### Usage:
Requirements:
* Java 11 or above
* MySQL (Optional)

Edit `application.properties` , change the `allnet.server.host` to your IP address or hostname.
DIVA won't work with localhost and 127.0.0.1

Then run `java -jar aqua.jar`

or use the `start.bat` if you are using windows.

User data will be save in data/db.sqlite.
If you switch to MySQL, it will auto create the table and import some initial data.

Please go to the database migration tool's website to check if the Database version is being supported https://flywaydb.org/documentation/database/mariadb 

### Configuration:
Configuration is save in `application.properties`

If you are going to deploy on other machine, you must change the `allnet.server.host` and `allnet.server.port` to the IP or Hostname of the hosting machine.
This will be send to the game at booting and being used by following request.

And you can switch to MySQL(MariaDB) database by commenting the Sqlite part.

#### Game specific setting:

##### CHUNITHM:
- Support auto profile downgrade now. You can just run any legacy version, but works better if you set a different keychip serial.
- You can enable team function and customize team name by changing `game.chunithm.team-name` value. Leave this blank to disable team function.

### Other Information:
This server provide a simple API for changing some DIVA's setting.

And DIVA screenshot will be save in data folder.
